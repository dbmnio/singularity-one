# Unreal learning path

My path for learning Unreal roughly went as follows

- Found the docs, went through the Getting Started walkthrough to get oriented and start to understand
  the terminology

- Went through another video I had seen in the past, which demoed all the cool features of Unreal that
  have recently come out.  It went from nothing, to a design of a building with lighting and Nanite textures,
  and terraforming the landscape to make it mountainous.

- Started implementing the concept for the game, aided by Gemini to learn the Unreal graphical interface,
  and how files are laid out in the project repo.
