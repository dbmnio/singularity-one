Ran tool

### **Phase 1: Foundation & Core Systems** üèóÔ∏è
*Goal: Establish the basic Singularity One framework*

**Core Systems to Implement:**
1. **Suit Integrity System**

   - Visual/audio feedback for different integrity levels
   - Permanent damage from falls/hazards

2. **Global Timer System**
   - Black hole growth timer as primary failure condition
   - HUD display showing time remaining
   - Visual/audio cues for urgency

3. **Enhanced Player Controller**
   - Modify existing third-person character for "barely in control" feel
   - Consistent controls but environmental chaos
   - Remove traditional death mechanics

4. **Basic UI System**
   - Suit integrity display
   - Timer display
   - Minimal HUD design for immersion

**End of Phase 1:** A playable character with suit integrity and timer systems in the laboratory level.

### **Phase 2: Physics Anomalies** ‚ö°
*Goal: Implement the signature "physics-defying" gameplay*

**Custom Physics Volume System (Gravity Vector Fields):**
1. **Custom UPhysicsVolume Class (C++)**
   - Inherit from UPhysicsVolume to create custom gravity fields
   - Implement dynamic vector field calculations for gravity direction/intensity
   - Support time-based gravity changes and real-time manipulation
   - Override physics calculations to affect all objects within volume

2. **Gravity Anomaly Zones**
   - Placeable volumes throughout the laboratory level
   - Visual indicators showing gravity field directions and intensities
   - Particle effects and audio cues for physics field visualization
   - Multiple overlapping volumes for complex gravity interactions

3. **Dynamic Physics Effects**
   - Real-time gravity vector modifications affecting both player and objects
   - Smooth transitions between different gravity fields
   - Physics objects (debris, equipment) respond to custom gravity
   - Player movement adaptation to changing gravity directions

4. **Advanced Field Behaviors**
   - Gravity intensity scaling (weak to strong fields)
   - Directional gravity (not just up/down - any 3D direction)
   - Time-based gravity oscillations and rotations
   - Gravity "wells" and "repulsion" zones

**End of Phase 2:** A sophisticated physics system with custom gravity volumes affecting all objects, creating dynamic and unpredictable environmental physics.

### **Phase 3: Laboratory Environment** üß™
*Goal: Transform the existing lab into a disaster-struck facility*

**Environmental Transformation:**
1. **Disaster State Design**
   - Modify existing lab level to show black hole damage
   - Add debris, sparking equipment, unstable structures
   - Lighting changes to show emergency state

2. **Navigation Challenges**
   - Design platforming routes through damaged facility
   - Use existing lab assets as climbing/jumping points
   - Create multiple paths with risk/reward choices

3. **Environmental Storytelling Setup**
   - Place audio log locations
   - Add computer terminals with backstory
   - Visual narrative through environmental damage

**End of Phase 3:** A fully navigable disaster-struck laboratory with clear objectives and environmental narrative.

## üîß **Technical Implementation Strategy**

**Leveraging Existing Assets:**
- **Laboratory Level**: Perfect setting - modify existing `Level_Laboratory_Demo.umap`
- **Character Systems**: Extend `BP_ThirdPersonCharacter` with suit integrity
- **MCP Tools**: Use Python automation for rapid prototyping
- **UI Framework**: Leverage existing UMG tools for HUD creation

**Code Organization Principles:**
- **Modular Systems**: Each phase builds discrete, testable components
- **Clear Interfaces**: Well-defined APIs between systems
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Each system documented for AI understanding
- **< 500 Lines**: Keep files small and focused per user guidelines

**Development Workflow:**
1. Use MCP Python tools for rapid Blueprint creation
2. Implement core systems as modular components
3. Test each phase independently before integration
4. Maintain clear separation between gameplay and narrative systems
